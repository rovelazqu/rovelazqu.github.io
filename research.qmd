<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

<br> Sustainability science has grown significantly as an interdisciplinary field in terms of publications and institutional relevance, yet continues to face substantial epistemological and methodological challenges. This article focuses on the critical self-reflection processes within sustainability science—defined as the systematic examination by scientists of their own knowledge production practices, methodologies, and epistemic foundations—as researchers actively construct this emerging field. This reflexive process, through which scientists critically assess both what they know and how they know it, plays a crucial role in consolidating sustainability science as a new scientific specialty. Through review of articles indexed in Web of Science (WoS) and SCOPUS up to July 2023 using key concepts of “science” and “sustainability” we identified 46 articles for analyzing these reflexive processes.

Our analysis reveals four cross-cutting dimensions structuring the field: 1) thematic delimitation, characterized by diversity yet fragmentation; 2) inter- and trans-disciplinary knowledge generation modes that, while widely endorsed, face significant implementation challenges; 3) the public and decisive character of knowledge; and 4) institutional configurations that both enable and constrain the field's development. The findings emphasize that sustainability science's reflexive process not only contributes to its own maturation as a scientific specialty but also offers valuable insights for broader societal questions regarding the production of relevant and public knowledge in the face of complex socio-ecological challenges. This reflexivity represents a distinctive feature that enables sustainability science to bridge disciplinary boundaries while fostering more participatory and transformative approaches to knowledge creation that can address pressing sustainability issues worldwide.

This work examines the diplomatic, political, and cultural impact of artistic internationalism on US-Chilean relations in 1968. Based on a micro-historical approach to the global Cold War, the article analyses the relationship between modernisation programmes and artistic modernism under the framework of the Alliance for Progress. The case study of ‘De Cézanne a Miró’, the most expensive art collection sent to Chile by the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA), reveals the creation, exportation, and reception of a distinctive cultural ethos promoted by US agents. The article traces the transnational networks that defined cultural encounters in a crucial year for domestic and global politics.

Interdisciplinary research is increasingly recognized as essential to address complex challenges in scientific production. However, understanding how interdisciplinarity shapes scientific ideas remains an open question. This presentation introduces a methodological framework in text analysis and mining to assess interdisciplinary integration in sustainability science using a semantic approach. By applying Structural Topic Models (STM) to a large corpus of academic publications from Latin America and the Caribbean (2000–2021), the paper examines how language structures influence scientific discourse.

Our analysis identifies key thematic trends in sustainability research, demonstrating that interdisciplinarity has evolved from fragmented disciplinary approaches to more integrated knowledge frameworks. Specifically, findings indicate that interdisciplinary integration significantly impacts topic prevalence, with energy research serving as a case study of how interdisciplinarity shapes the semantic structure of sustainability science. The results reveal that high levels of interdisciplinarity were initially associated with a lower level of involvement in energy-related discussions, but became a strong predictor of topic prominence in later periods.

This presentation explores the conditions that shape artistic success in cultural markets where private investment and philanthropy are not dominant forces in cultural production. Using the Chilean context—characterized by a strong model of state cultural funding—the analysis revisits and challenges Bones' (1989) assumptions by presenting empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis that social connections remain critical, particularly those involving public institutions, policymakers, and cultural gatekeepers.

Methodologically, the study employs a predictive framework based on generalized linear models (GLMs), using artists' funding-related attributes as key predictors of market success. Specifically, it estimates the probability of contemporary art sales through two-level hierarchical models that account for contextual variation across time and space. This approach enables the analysis to assess how different forms of institutional support influence sales performance, particularly in relation to the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In recent years, social scientists have increasingly focused on the production of cultural value as a prime example of the structure-content duality. Building on Ronald Breiger's seminal work (1974), this presentation offers a socio-semantic network analysis of the contemporary art market, exploring the underlying mechanisms that shape its organizing principles. The research contributes to the existing literature by adopting a relational perspective to address core questions previously overlooked by economic and cultural analyses. Specifically, it examines the roles of organizational cultures and aesthetic topics in structuring the market for symbolic goods, the significance of various connections for competitiveness in the art scene, and the impact of social networks on access to social and symbolic resources in the art world. Methodologically this work combines Multilevel Exponential Random Graphs (MERGMs) and Structural Topic Models (STMs).

In recent years, the study of organizational fields within creative networks has become a focal point for examining both formal and informal relationships that contribute to value-making processes. This presentation centers on the inter-organizational field of contemporary art to empirically assess how 'valuable' art pieces emerge as a byproduct of the brokerage power exercised by organizations. By adopting a two-mode network perspective, this work provides an empirical approach to a classical sociological issue: under what conditions can homophilic selection affect access to material and symbolic resources in the art world? Ultimately, it seeks to determine which types of connections are crucial for convincing the art scene of an artist's creative potential.

The presentation investigates the impact of Chile's neoliberal cultural production reforms on aesthetic preferences and cultural repertoires. Using longitudinal data, the analysis estimates consumer patterns based on variations in aesthetic tastes across ten fields of cultural production. Hierarchical clustering is employed to categorize consumers into three types: omnivores, univores, and those with cultural variety. The study evaluates individual attributes influencing taste preferences, including gender, age, ethnicity, educational attainment, and the aesthetic dispositions reported by respondents.
