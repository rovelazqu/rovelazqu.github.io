I am open to research collaborations in the broader fields of social and computational sciences, with particular interest in projects that engage with computational methodologies, social network analysis, social theory, and interdisciplinary approaches to cultural analysis.

I welcome opportunities for collaboration both locally and internationally, and I am especially interested in contributing to international research initiatives. Scholars, researchers, or institutions interested in potential collaboration are invited to contact me at `ravelasq@uc.cl`
