The reflexive process in sustainability science: A short critical review. Environmental Science & Policy, Volume 171, 2025, 104145. DOI: 10.1016/j.envsci.2025.104145\n\n\nAbstract\n\n Sustainability science has grown significantly as an interdisciplinary field in terms of publications and institutional relevance, yet continues to face substantial epistemological and methodological challenges. This article focuses on the critical self-reflection processes within sustainability science—defined as the systematic examination by scientists of their own knowledge production practices, methodologies, and epistemic foundations—as researchers actively construct this emerging field. This reflexive process, through which scientists critically assess both what they know and how they know it, plays a crucial role in consolidating sustainability science as a new scientific specialty. Through review of articles indexed in Web of Science (WoS) and SCOPUS up to July 2023 using key concepts of “science” and “sustainability” we identified 46 articles for analyzing these reflexive processes.\nOur analysis reveals four cross-cutting dimensions structuring the field: 1) thematic delimitation, characterized by diversity yet fragmentation; 2) inter- and trans-disciplinary knowledge generation modes that, while widely endorsed, face significant implementation challenges; 3) the public and decisive character of knowledge; and 4) institutional configurations that both enable and constrain the field’s development. The findings emphasize that sustainability science’s reflexive process not only contributes to its own maturation as a scientific specialty but also offers valuable insights for broader societal questions regarding the production of relevant and public knowledge in the face of complex socio-ecological challenges. This reflexivity represents a distinctive feature that enables sustainability science to bridge disciplinary boundaries while fostering more participatory and transformative approaches to knowledge creation that can address pressing sustainability issues worldwide.\n\n2022\nMardones, Antonia; Velázquez-Quiroz, Roberto; Mardones, Pablo; Espinosa, Maria Paz.

The case study of ‘De Cézanne a Miró’, the most expensive art collection sent to Chile by the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA), reveals the creation, exportation, and reception of a distinctive cultural ethos promoted by US agents. The article traces the transnational networks that defined cultural encounters in a crucial year for domestic and global politics."

However, understanding how interdisciplinarity shapes scientific ideas remains an open question. This presentation introduces a methodological framework in text analysis and mining to assess interdisciplinary integration in sustainability science using a semantic approach. By applying Structural Topic Models (STM) to a large corpus of academic publications from Latin America and the Caribbean (2000–2021), the paper examines how language structures influence scientific discourse.\nOur analysis identifies key thematic trends in sustainability research, demonstrating that interdisciplinarity has evolved from fragmented disciplinary approaches to more integrated knowledge frameworks. Specifically, findings indicate that interdisciplinary integration significantly impacts topic prevalence, with energy research serving as a case study of how interdisciplinarity shapes the semantic structure of sustainability science. The results reveal that high levels of interdisciplinarity were initially associated with a lower level of involvement in energy-related discussions, but became a strong predictor of topic prominence in later periods.\n\n\n\n\nFig: Two-mode Relational Simmilarity on Abstract Corpora\n\n\n\n2024\nVelázquez-Quiroz, Roberto.

Using the Chilean context—characterized by a strong model of state cultural funding—the analysis revisits and challenges Bones’ (1989) assumptions by presenting empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis that social connections remain critical, particularly those involving public institutions, policymakers, and cultural gatekeepers.\nMethodologically, the study employs a predictive framework based on generalized linear models (GLMs), using artists’ funding-related attributes as key predictors of market success. Specifically, it estimates the probability of contemporary art sales through two-level hierarchical models that account for contextual variation across time and space. This approach enables the analysis to assess how different forms of institutional support influence sales performance, particularly in relation to the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\nFig: Covariate Effect Comparison\n\n\n\nVelázquez-Quiroz, Roberto.

Building on Ronald Breiger’s seminal work (1974), this presentation offers a socio-semantic network analysis of the contemporary art market, exploring the underlying mechanisms that shape its organizing principles. The research contributes to the existing literature by adopting a relational perspective to address core questions previously overlooked by economic and cultural analyses. Specifically, it examines the roles of organizational cultures and aesthetic topics in structuring the market for symbolic goods, the significance of various connections for competitiveness in the art scene, and the impact of social networks on access to social and symbolic resources in the art world. Methodologically this work combines Multilevel Exponential Random Graphs (MERGMs) and Structural Topic Models (STMs).\n\n\n\n\nFig: Socio-semantic Network of Contemporary Art (Early-career Artists).\n\n\n\n2023\nVelázquez-Quiroz, Roberto.

This presentation centers on the inter-organizational field of contemporary art to empirically assess how ‘valuable’ art pieces emerge as a byproduct of the brokerage power exercised by organizations. By adopting a two-mode network perspective, this work provides an empirical approach to a classical sociological issue: under what conditions can homophilic selection affect access to material and symbolic resources in the art world? Ultimately, it seeks to determine which types of connections are crucial for convincing the art scene of an artist’s creative potential.\n\n2021\nVelázquez-Quiroz, Roberto.

The study focuses on the structuring of scientific networks, encompassing both expert and non-expert actors. Methodologically, the research addresses field configuration using a scientometric approach, which combines two-mode network analysis and structural topic modeling on big data sources. Led by Dr. Julien Van Hulst, this project is sponsored by the National Research and Development Agency in Chile (FONDECYT N°1220560, Chile).\nKeywords: Sustainability Science, Sociology of Science, Social Network Analysis, Structural Semantic Analysis.\n\nInequality of Outcomes and Opportunities\nResearch Assistant\nThe project examines the distinct causal effects of exposure to inequality of opportunity and inequality of outcomes on (i) beliefs about the causes of inequality and perceptions of economic fairness and (ii) the propensity to cooperate and redistribute. Methodologically, the research relies on a series of large-scale online experiments that randomly expose individuals to artificial, society-like environments with varying levels of outcome and opportunity inequality. This approach allows the project to circumvent the limitations of previous observational and experimental research by recreating and manipulating exposure to different types of inequality in the lab.

Combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection, the analysis aims to describe the formation mechanisms within the inter-organizational space of cultural group identities. The main hypothesis to be tested is whether aesthetic affinities can bridge socioeconomic differences allowing social cohesion and network density.
