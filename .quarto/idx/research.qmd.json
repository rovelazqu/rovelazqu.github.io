This article focuses on the critical self-reflection processes within sustainability science—defined as the systematic examination by scientists of their own knowledge production practices, methodologies, and epistemic foundations—as researchers actively construct this emerging field. This reflexive process, through which scientists critically assess both what they know and how they know it, plays a crucial role in consolidating sustainability science as a new scientific specialty. Through review of articles indexed in Web of Science (WoS) and SCOPUS up to July 2023 using key concepts of “science” and “sustainability” we identified 46 articles for analyzing these reflexive processes.\n\nOur analysis reveals four cross-cutting dimensions structuring the field: 1) thematic delimitation, characterized by diversity yet fragmentation; 2) inter- and trans-disciplinary knowledge generation modes that, while widely endorsed, face significant implementation challenges; 3) the public and decisive character of knowledge; and 4) institutional configurations that both enable and constrain the field's development. The findings emphasize that sustainability science's reflexive process not only contributes to its own maturation as a scientific specialty but also offers valuable insights for broader societal questions regarding the production of relevant and public knowledge in the face of complex socio-ecological challenges. This reflexivity represents a distinctive feature that enables sustainability science to bridge disciplinary boundaries while fostering more participatory and transformative approaches to knowledge creation that can address pressing sustainability issues worldwide.\n\n</details>\n\n**2022**\n\nMardones, Antonia; **Velázquez-Quiroz, Roberto**; Mardones, Pablo; Espinosa, Maria Paz.

However, understanding how interdisciplinarity shapes scientific ideas remains an open question. This presentation introduces a methodological framework in text analysis and mining to assess interdisciplinary integration in sustainability science using a semantic approach. By applying Structural Topic Models (STM) to a large corpus of academic publications from Latin America and the Caribbean (2000–2021), the paper examines how language structures influence scientific discourse.\n\nOur analysis identifies key thematic trends in sustainability research, demonstrating that interdisciplinarity has evolved from fragmented disciplinary approaches to more integrated knowledge frameworks. Specifically, findings indicate that interdisciplinary integration significantly impacts topic prevalence, with energy research serving as a case study of how interdisciplinarity shapes the semantic structure of sustainability science. The results reveal that high levels of interdisciplinarity were initially associated with a lower level of involvement in energy-related discussions, but became a strong predictor of topic prominence in later periods.\n\n<br>\n\n![Fig: Two-mode Relational Simmilarity on Abstract Corpora](img/con2.png){width=\"70%\"}\n\n</details>\n\n**2024**\n\n**Velázquez-Quiroz, Roberto**.

Using the Chilean context—characterized by a strong model of state cultural funding—the analysis revisits and challenges Bones' (1989) assumptions by presenting empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis that social connections remain critical, particularly those involving public institutions, policymakers, and cultural gatekeepers.\n\nMethodologically, the study employs a predictive framework based on generalized linear models (GLMs), using artists' funding-related attributes as key predictors of market success. Specifically, it estimates the probability of contemporary art sales through two-level hierarchical models that account for contextual variation across time and space. This approach enables the analysis to assess how different forms of institutional support influence sales performance, particularly in relation to the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n<br>\n\n![Fig: Covariate Effect Comparison](img/con1.png){width=\"70%\"}\n\n</details>\n\n**Velázquez-Quiroz, Roberto**.
