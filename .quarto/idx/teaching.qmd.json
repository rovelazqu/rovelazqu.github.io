Through a combination of lectures, discussions, and practical assignments, students will learn to collect and interpret data effectively. Weekly assignments are designed to reinforce these skills, providing hands-on experience in applying theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the tools and methodologies necessary for conducting high-standard academic work.\n\n<br>\n\n| **SOL166**     |                       **Sociology of Art**                   |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| **Level**      | Undergraduate course                               |\n| **Language**      | Spanish                              |\n| **Department**     | Department of Sociology, UC Chile                  |\n| **Term**      | Fall Semester 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020                                 |\n| **Location**  | Santiago, Chile                                    |\n| **Syllabus**  | Upon request `ravelasq@uc.cl`                                    |\n\nThis course offers a sociological perspective on art and aesthetics, delving into influential authors from both theoretical and methodological viewpoints.
