Methodologically, the research relies on a series of large-scale online experiments that randomly expose individuals to artificial, society-like environments with varying levels of outcome and opportunity inequality. This approach allows the project to circumvent the limitations of previous observational and experimental research by recreating and manipulating exposure to different types of inequality in the lab.
